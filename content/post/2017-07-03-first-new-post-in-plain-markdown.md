This weekâ€™s studio session aimed at giving us practice with user research, specifically observation. In studio, our task was to observe a practice field site and take field notes. We then returned to discuss our notes and present our work to the class.

I loved the experience of observing and making field notes, as it was the first time I worked on a project like this. However, I encountered a couple problems during the process. It was difficult for me to decide on a task to expand and fix. After much contemplation, I decided on students that are required to pay for tickets because their Husky card is defected. I later realised that the practice I chose was the one which I related to the most. This bias caused me to choose this practice even though there might have been more common problems. Therefore, in the future, I will not allow my bias to affect my design decisions.

Reflexivity affected my user research in many ways. Earlier I mentioned how my bias toward the practice and observation caused me to choose it for my design challenge. I also took my field notes in a very specific way. Instead of observing everything that happened around me, I focused on people waiting for the bus, getting on the bus and getting off. Though this allows me to have more details, it also causes me to miss other important practices or events that could have occurred. I primarily focused on the practices that are common to the location rather than unique practices. This caused my field notes to be mainly focused on the three activities.
